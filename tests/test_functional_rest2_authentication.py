"""Test function of an actual login against a live RT instance.

This file aims to verify which different authentication methods work and which
don't. It will also help to track if an authentication method that's broken
will eventually be fixed in a certain RT version.

 * The tests in this file all require a live RT instance that can receive
   requests.
 * The tests also require that the credential information be valid for
   permitting login to the RT instance.

This file uses credentials that are valid for the docker image
netsandbox/request-tracker:4.4, so you can use this image to run tests
locally.
